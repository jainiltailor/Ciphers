# Ciphers

Welcome to the **Ciphers** repository! This repository contains implementations and explanations of various classical cryptographic ciphers. Each cipher has its own subfolder with detailed information and code examples.

## Contents

- **[Caesar-Cipher](./Caesar-Cipher/)**: Implementation of the Caesar Cipher, a substitution cipher where each letter in the plaintext is shifted by a fixed number of positions down the alphabet.
- **[Hill-Cipher](./Hill-Cipher/)**: Implementation of the Hill Cipher, a polygraphic substitution cipher based on linear algebra, using matrix multiplication to encrypt and decrypt messages.
- **[Monoalphabetic-Cipher](./Monoalphabetic-Cipher/)**: Implementation of the Monoalphabetic Cipher, a substitution cipher where each letter of the plaintext is mapped to a corresponding letter in the ciphertext.
- **[Playfair-Cipher](./Playfair-Cipher/)**: Implementation of the Playfair Cipher, a digraph substitution cipher that encrypts pairs of letters instead of single letters.
- **[Rail-Cipher](./Rail-Cipher/)**: Implementation of the Rail Fence Cipher, a transposition cipher that arranges the plaintext in a zigzag pattern across multiple rails.
- **[Transposition-Cipher](./Transposition-Cipher/)**: Implementation of the Transposition Cipher, which rearranges the characters of the plaintext according to a defined system.
- **[Vigenere-Cipher](./Vigenere-Cipher/)**: Implementation of the Vigenere Cipher, a polyalphabetic substitution cipher that uses a keyword to shift the letters of the plaintext by varying amounts.

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/jainiltailor/Ciphers.git
    ```

2. **Navigate to the desired cipher**:
    ```bash
    cd Ciphers/Caesar-Cipher
    ```

3. **Run the cipher code**:
    Follow the instructions in the README file within each cipher's folder to run the code.

## Ciphers Overview

Cryptographic ciphers are methods of encrypting and decrypting information to protect its confidentiality. The ciphers implemented in this repository are classical encryption techniques that laid the groundwork for modern cryptography.

- **Substitution Ciphers**: Replace each element of the plaintext with another element.
- **Transposition Ciphers**: Rearrange the elements of the plaintext according to a specific system.
